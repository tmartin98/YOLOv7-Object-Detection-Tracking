# YOLOv7 Object Detection & Tracking

A comprehensive Python implementation of YOLOv7 for real-time object detection and tracking in videos and images. This project provides an easy-to-use interface for the official YOLOv7 model with additional features like object tracking, filtering, and statistics.

## Features

- üöÄ Real-time object detection using YOLOv7
- üìπ Video processing with frame-by-frame detection
- üéØ Object tracking with trajectory visualization
- üîç Class-specific filtering (e.g., detect only persons)
- üìä Live FPS counter and object statistics
- üíæ Export detections to text files
- üñºÔ∏è Single image detection support
- ‚ö° GPU acceleration support

## Model Information

### Pretrained Weights

This implementation uses YOLOv7 models pretrained on the **MS COCO dataset** (80 classes). The models were trained from scratch without using pretrained weights from other datasets.

**Available Models:**

| Model | Size | AP | FPS | Params | FLOPs |
|-------|------|----|----|--------|-------|
| YOLOv7 | 640 | 51.4% | 161 | 37.6M | 105.2G |
| YOLOv7-X | 640 | 53.1% | 114 | 71.3M | 189.9G |
| YOLOv7-W6 | 1280 | 54.9% | 84 | 70.4M | 360.0G |
| YOLOv7-E6 | 1280 | 56.0% | 56 | 97.2M | 515.2G |
| YOLOv7-D6 | 1280 | 56.6% | 44 | 154.7M | 806.8G |
| YOLOv7-E6E | 1280 | 56.8% | 36 | 151.7M | 843.2G |

### COCO Dataset

- **Dataset Size:** 330,000 images (118,000 training, 5,000 validation)
- **Number of Classes:** 80 object categories
- **Annotations:** 1.5 million object instances
- **Download:** [https://cocodataset.org](https://cocodataset.org)
